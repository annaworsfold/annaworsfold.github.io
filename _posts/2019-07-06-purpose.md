## Learn with purpose and apply it

I have learnt that there are two things that you need to keep motivated with learning and to make sure it sticks.

1. Learn with a purpose
2. Apply your learning

If you read an article, listen to a podcast or start a learning course without a clear purpose then one of the following can happen:

* You tune out half way through (*just because you got to the end doesn't mean anything*)
* You forget what you've learnt after a week (*if that*)
* You get bored and get sucked into a deep never-ending spiral of funny cat videos and when your battery dies you realise its 1am (*you know who you are*)

Don't waste your time. Your time is precious. Make sure you make the most of the time by making sure you have a purpose for doing it and then actually apply it to something. And make it a useful and specific purpose. Not just "I want to learn to upskill". Don't give me that. It has to be "I want to learn because I want to apply it to [insert problem you want to solve]". Let me give you an example.

## An example

For me, I had an opportunity to go on secondment into a Data Analytics team for 4 months and I was eager to get started on learning SQL. So I looked up some training videos and books (I was about to go on holiday and thought it could be something to do on the plane) and got learning. You would think that my purpose was clear. "I'm learning so that I can be ready for my secondment." Nope. Didn't play the videos or open the book once. Fast forward a month into my secondment when I actually had to join two reports together so that I could upload it onto Tableau to do analysis and **BAM** I couldn't get enough of the training videos because I knew that I would be able to apply it to my work and do a good job at it.

## Don't really have a purpose? Make it up!

If you don't have a specific purpose or situation then make one up. Join a discussion group or volunteer to present on the topic. Write a blog! You will find that you will feel like it is a better use of your time and that will keep you motivated to keep going and what you learn will actually stick.

## Find your purpose in 5 minutes

Speaking of purpose, I was just watching a video called "How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes" by Adam Leipzig. I was surprised at how simple and effective his method is. Have a watch:

In summary, you can do this by asking five simple questions:

1. Who are you? *Anna*
2. What do you love to do? *Solve problems.*
3. Who do you do it for? *People I care about.*
4. What do those people want or need? *Someone to help them solve a problem or make their job more meaningful.*
5. How do they change as a result of what you give them? *They can spend time doing things that are meaningful to them.*

The same questions could be asked in a learning context:

1. Who are you? *Anna*
2. What do you want to learn? *Python*
3. Who do you do it for? *My colleagues*
4. What do those people want or need? *Someone to help them remove manual processes.*
5. How do they change as a result of what you give them? *They can spend time performing analysis and providing insights.*

And that is what I do it for. What is your purpose?
