## Firstly, let me introduce myself

A few things about me:

* My name is Anna Worsfold
* A born and bred Kiwi currently living it up in Melbourne, Australia
* Worked in Tax for over 10 years ( *and still loving it* )
* Extremely passionate about using technology to change the way we work
* And I don't know about you but am freaking out about how to make sure I still have a job in the future workforce.

I remember very vividly the moment when the penny dropped for me.

## A raging fire ignites

I was at a CTA conference in Sydney and the main theme for the event was **"Embracing the Challenge of Change"** and the very first session was about Technology and the Tax Function of the Future. I had been so busy and heads down into spreadsheets and position papers ( *and avoiding eye contact with the restructuring machine* ) that I didn't realise the world was already changing around me and I wasn't doing anything to keep up and certainly nothing to make sure I would remain relevant in the workforce. I remember sitting up, leaning in and drinking in every word of [Stephen Scheeler's](https://stephenscheeler.com.au/) (Former CEO of Facebook Australia) presentation. I remember the exact moment the spark inside me ignited. The way we worked could be better, faster, less manual and with more insight and intelligence. **I** could be better. I had to become better to stay relevant and ensure I had a job or at least have the relevant skills to get a job if my time ended with my current company.

It was with that raging fire and excitement that I left that conference feeling like I had a real sense of purpose again and I could make a difference to not only my life but the lives of others through this amazing thing called Technology.

## A slow burn

And while the fire still burns, I must admit that I have come to realise that it will be a slow burn. The amount of information out there on soft skills, career development, automation, robotics, machine learning and AI is so vast that it is almost incomprehensible. How can I possibly read and understand it all? What is good and useful versus just click bait with no real practical substance?

## Follow me on my journey

The purpose of this website is to share my journey with you. What has worked. What hasn't worked. What's good to read and what you'll learn from it. Maybe some tips on how to do certain things ( *it's mostly for me to remember - I have a memory of a goldfish* ). Often things you read from Big 4 CA firms are very wishy-washy and a bit cagey because they don't want to give too much away. This is a place where I will give it to you straight and give you real practical pointers so you don't have to waste your time.

It's a journey that we all have to take at some point and maybe the penny has dropped or maybe you're still waiting for that defining moment. Either way, I hope you get something out of this space that helps you, your career and your development.
